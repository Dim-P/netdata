/**
 * @brief Parameters of the query.
 * @param[in] start_timestamp Start timestamp of query in epoch milliseconds.
 * @param[in,out] end_timestamp End timestamp of query in epoch milliseconds. It returns the actual end timestamp of the query which may not match the
                                end timestamp passed as input, in case there are more results to be retrieved that would exceed the desired max quota.
 * @param[in] chart_name Chart name of log source to be queried, as it appears on the netdata dashboard. 
 *                       If this is defined and not an empty string, the filename parameter is ignored.
 * @param[in] filename Full path of log source to be queried. Will only be used if the chart_name is not used.
 * @param[in,out] results_buff Buffer of BUFFER type to store the results of the query in. 
                               results_buff->size Defines the maximum quota of results to be expected. If exceeded, the query will return the results obtained so far.
                               results_buff->len The exact size of the results matched. 
                               results_buff->buffer String containing the results of the query.
